# TheLazyTraveler

1911 - Fullstack Academy Capstone Project

Project URL: https://thelazytraveler.herokuapp.com

## Description

An automated trip planner that generates an itinerary with dates and times for a traveler. The automated itinerary is based on user inputs (such as location to where they are traveler and any specific interests).

A user is able to input their trip by location, duration and include their interests.

* Interest checkbox will generate first iteration of recommendations.
* Users will interactively choose whether they like the recommended places we have provided them based on certain criterias (e.g., users will be able to click and drag each activity which will determine whether they like the recommendations or not).

## TechStack

Our tech stack includes React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Google Places/Maps/Geocoding API and Node.js.

Major packages used include: Material-UI React and React Beautiful DnD.

Aspects of the project we found interesting were:

* Creating an interactive drag and drop feature for the user to control which places they would like to include in their itinerary.
* Designing an algorithm using Google Places API to create a recommendation list of places for the user based on where they are traveling to (i.e. location), dates of travel and their interested preferences. We scoped those preferences by the following categories: arts, museums, fine dining, nightlife, shopping and family friendly activities.

## Technical Challenges

To be updated
